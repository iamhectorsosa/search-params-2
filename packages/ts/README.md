# Search Params

Read and write [URLSearchParams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams) with full type-safety using `@search-params/ts` using any UI framework and any schema validation library.

## Documentation

For usage development reference the project's [readme.md](../../readme.md) for more detailed information.

## Introduction

This project is heavily inspired by TanStack's Router [Search Params](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/guide/search-params) with the exception that (a) it isn't limited to a specific React framework and (b) it reads and writes Search Params using the same hook.

### Why Search Params?

The URL Search Params is perfectly able to act as a form of global state. If you would like to know more about this, give TanStack's Router [Search Params, the "OG" State Manager](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/guide/search-params#search-params-the-og-state-manager) a read.
